# Spatial Clustering of Molecular Localizations with MIRO

**MIRO** (Multifunctional Integration through Relational Optimization) is a geometric deep learning framework that enhances clustering algorithms by transforming complex point clouds into structured, compact representations. It enables more robust clustering of single-molecule localization data using recurrent graph neural networks (rGNNs).

## How it works?
**MIRO** learns to pull together localizations belonging to the same structure, producing spatially compact, well-separated clusters. This transformation enables standard algorithms like DBSCAN to perform significantly better â€” especially in challenging scenarios involving varying densities, blinking artifacts, or multiple cluster types.

## Key Features  
- **Improved Clustering Performance:** MIRO increases the efficiency of existing clustering algorithms by transforming point clouds into an optimized format.  
- **Simplified Parameter Selection:** By enhancing the differentiation among clusters and their separation from the background, **MIRO** streamlines parameter selection for clustering methods like DBSCAN.
- **Single-Shot and Few-Shot Learning:** **MIRO**â€™s single- or few-shot learning capability allows it to generalize across scenarios with minimal training, making it highly efficient and versatile.
- **Multiscale Clustering:** **MIRO**â€™s recurrent structure allows for identifying patterns at different scales. 
- **Broad Applicability:** **MIRO** is effective across datasets with diverse cluster shapes and symmetries.
